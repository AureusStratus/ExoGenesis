A mod that adds a lot more content to the game.
<br>I just hope you guys enjoy my mod.

`note`: The plasma orb trail idea originally came from the exotic mod as well as the energy sphere ability on my primordial, and earth unit

## The mod adds: 
A lot of stuff, including many new units, turrets, five factions and more

## Mod races/factions 
Exogenesis contains five different races each with their own lore, weapons, defenses, and units.

`Credits to ƒêuvent for making both the lore of the factions and the two attack maps`

`Genesux`: In the "Siravax System" they live on the sub-zero temperature planet called "Siratla", and one of the other planets in the system is also comprised of Siratla Stone and Crystals, Ruxt, while Vantax is a gaseous planet. These three specific planets also have multiple satelites(moons) orbiting them, and the star is named Siravax. The Genesux are comprised of cold energy and Siratla stone, meaning they're a type of lithiod. These beings are strong, their weapons and creations are made out of metal-like material formed from various metals and cold energy. Little is understood of their ultimate goal, but it seems that nothing will stop them from achieving it.

`Solran`: These lithiod lifeforms are almost the exact opposite of the Genesux since they are extremely hot and have capabilities out of this galaxy. They are found in the "Alphandax System", which is an astronomical question, since this is a Binary System with Alphandax and Betanax, but there are planets orbiting them. These creatures are comprised of molten rock and materials they extract from under the volcanoes and lava oceans of their planet Volceru. They get titanium and multiple igna-rocks and they fuse them together to get a strong material that they use to form their absolute monsters. Other satelites/planets in this Binary System include Furnius and Siten.

`Elecian`: They are found in the "Vanstarius System" where they live on a gassy planet with 3/4 satelites, and other planets in this system also have satelites. The other planets are Ravu, Duris and Mineus, although Duris and Mineus don't have satelites we will still include them. The Eleciams are monsters when it comes to destruction and show no mercy. Their technology is very advanced and they are unmatched in their will to fight. They are very strong and can pack quite a punch, whether you have walls or not. The material that they use is unknown and is probably an alloy made out of titanium and some other material.

`Terretux`: Deep in the Bootes Void, in galaxy long dead, there lies a fallen empire, destroyed by a cataclysmic event. Astronomeers from Serpulo call it the "Forgotten Empire". This species originated from the "Erten system", with planets surrounding it such as Xeantra and Celtus. They are powered by Pure Dark Energy and an unknown form of energy, which  they use to create their strong and strange materials to create weapons and technology yet to be understood. What could have happened to this great empire?

`Quantra`: These peaceful, Aquatic Plant Creatures are found in the "Lumian System", and although they aren't observed as much as the others, they've developed underwater and on islands and shores. They live in a radioactive area of an ocean. They somehow get enough materials to make a variety naval weapons, and they will also invent other weapons that can devastate anything.
