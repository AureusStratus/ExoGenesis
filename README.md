A mod that adds a lot more content to the game.
<br>I just hope you guys enjoy my mod.

`Note`: The plasma orb trail idea originally came from the Exotic mod as well as the energy sphere ability on my primordial and earth unit

## The mod adds: 
A lot of neat stuff, including five new factions, tons of new blocks, lore, and more!

## Mod races/factions 
Exogenesis contains five different races each with their own lore, weapons, defenses, and units.

`Credits to ƒêuvent for making both the lore of the factions and the two attack maps`

`Genesux`: In the "Siravax System" they inhabit the sub-zero temperature planet named "Siratla", and while there is another planet in the system that is comrpised of Siratla Stone and Crystals (Ruxt), Vantax is a Gas Planet. these three specific planets also have multiple satelites (moons) surrounding them. The star is Siravax and the Genesux are comprised of cold energy and Siratla stone; they are a type of lithiod, these beings are strong, and their weapons and creations are made out of metalic material formed from various metals and cold energy. Little is understood of their ultimate goal, but it seems like nothing is going to stop them from achieving it.

`Solran`: These lithiod lifeforms are almost an Opposition of the Genesux since they are extremely hot/molten and have capabilities out of this galaxy, they are found in the "Alphandax System", which is an astronomical question, since this is a Binary System with Alphandax and Betanax, but there are planets orbiting. Moving on we have these creatures; they are comprised of molten rock and material they get from under the volcanoes and lava oceans of their planet Volceru, they can also get titanium and multiple igna-rocks which they fuse them together to get a strong material that they use to form their absolute monsters. Other satelites/planets in this Binary System include Furnius and Siten.

`Elecian`: They are found in the "Vanstarius System", they live on a gassy planet with 3/4 satelites, other planets in this system also have satelites, the other planets are, Ravu, Duris. Mineus, although Duris and Mineus dont have satelites we will still include them, the Eleciams are monsters at destruction and show no mercy, their technology are very advanced and are un-matched in there will to fight, they are very strong and can pack quite a punch, wether you have walls or not, the material that they use are unknown and are probably an alloy made out of titanium and some other material.

`Terretux`: deep Bootes Void, in galaxy long dead there lies a fallen empire, destroyed by a cataclysmic event. Astronomeers from Serpulo call it the "Forgotten empire", this species originated from the "Erten system", with planets surrounding it such as Xeantra and Celtus, They are powered by Pure Dark Energy and an unknown form of energy, they use their strong and strange materials to create weapons and technology yet understood. What had happen to this great empire?.

`Quantra`: These peaceful, Aquatic Plant Creatures are found in the "Lumian System", they arent observed as much as the others but have developed underwater and on islands and shores, they live in an radioactive biome of an ocean, they somehow get their materials to make several naval weapons, they will also invent other weapons that devastate everything.
